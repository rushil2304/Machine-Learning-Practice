# Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository contains hands-on projects and practice notebooks for both **Supervised** and **Unsupervised Learning** techniques in Machine Learning using Python.

## 🔍 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning models are trained on labeled data. This section includes:
- **Linear Regression** – Predict continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression** – Classification tasks.
- **Decision Tree** – Simple and interpretable models.
- **Random Forest** – Ensemble method improving accuracy and robustness.
- **Support Vector Machine** – Uses support vectors to give results
- **KNN** – Uses mathematical formulas to classify data points
- **XGBoost** – Uses mathematical formulas to classify data points
   

## 🔎 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning models deal with unlabeled data. This section covers:
- **K-Means Clustering** – Partition data into clusters.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – Dimensionality reduction technique.
- **DBSCAN** – Density-based clustering.
- **K-Medoids** – A centroid based clustering
